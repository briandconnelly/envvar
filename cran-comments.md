## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. I've made the following changes since my previous submission:

* Documentation for functions with no return value has been update to explicitly state this
* For examples that may fail in some instances, replace \dontrun with \donttest

* I have NOT added any references to the package description, as there are none

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.
